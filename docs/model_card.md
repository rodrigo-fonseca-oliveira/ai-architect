# Model Card

## Overview
- Model: Logistic Regression (sklearn)
- Use case: Binary classification (demo)
- Owner: Rodrigo
- Date: 2025-10-04

## Intended Use
- Demo for MLflow logging and serving via /predict
- Not for production use

## Training Data
- Dataset: Synthetic via sklearn.make_classification (see Data Card)
- Features: f0..f7, Target: 0/1
- Train/test split: 75/25

## Metrics
- Reported in ml/train.py: accuracy, AUC (on test split)
- Example (from a recent run): accuracy ~0.81, AUC ~0.91

## Evaluation
- Quick hold-out test only; no cross-validation
- No fairness or robustness tests included

## Limitations & Risks
- Not calibrated; may be overconfident
- Synthetic data; no guarantees on real-world performance
- No bias analysis

## Ethical Considerations
- Avoid using this model in real decision-making
- For real deployments, include bias/fairness audits and governance

## Maintenance & Versioning
- Logged to MLflow with params/metrics/artifacts
- Model version tracked by run_id
- Retraining criteria: drift (PSI) or performance thresholds
